To build: 
    Try 'make'
    If it does not work: edit Makefile

To use:
    ./sound
    <type stuff>

Example:

./sound
[satwb0-9q] (sin) > 440         # plays a sine at 440 Hz
[satwb0-9q] (sin) > a           # switch to saw generator
[satwb0-9q] (saw) > 330         # play a saw wave at 440 Hz
[satwb0-9q] (saw) > t           # switch to triangle generator
[satwb0-9q] (triangle) > 65     # you get the idea...
[satwb0-9q] (triangle) > w      # switch to white noise
[satwb0-9q] (white) > 9         # enter any numeric value here, does not matter
[satwb0-9q] (white) > b         # switch to brown noise
[satwb0-9q] (brown) > 9         # see above
[satwb0-9q] (brown) > q         # quit (any other than satwb0-9 quits)
