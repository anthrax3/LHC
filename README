=== API ===

player.new(callback, samplerate, channels, buffer_size)
   Creates a new player object.
   Default values:
      samplerate  ... 44100
      channels    ... 1
      buffer_size ... 2048

callback(out, frames, pos, rate, channels)
   Generates samples.
   Arguments:
      out       ... Table to write the samples (performance reasons).
                    Contains the samples from previous run.
      frames    ... Number of frames to run. One frame consists of the
                    samples for all channels.
      pos       ... Starting sample position. E.g. with buffer_size = 1024,
                    pos = 0 on the first run, pos = 1024 on the second, and so on.
      rate      ... Samplerate. Get the sample time with pos/rate.
      channels  ... Number of channels. With more than one channel, samples need
                    to be written interleaved, i.e. with channels = 2:
                    out[1] = sample[1].left, out[2] = sample[1].right, out[3] = sample[2].left, ...
